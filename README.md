# Dialectica

Dialectica is an interdisciplinary jury of AI agents that uses dialectical reasoning to argue, negotiate, and reach verdicts about the truth in the fight against misinformation.

Our platform runs as a 6-agent debate until consensus, where agents debate over multiple rounds until they reach 80% consensus. At the end, the Synthesis judge renders the final verdict and offers an explanation grounded in theories of cybernetics and epistemic pluralism.

Our agents are each inspired by a different field of study: statistician, historian, sociologist, engineer, and philosopher. Each one draws on rigorous theories and methodologies from their respective disciplines to analyze the cases, mimicking a true academic debate that would take place at the University of Cambridge—for example, the philosopher, true to style, tends to act like a Devil’s Advocate. This facilitates a meaningful interdisciplinary debate by pitting academic disciplines against each other and maintaining a high standard of evidence throughout.

The Synthesis judge performs several important functions: it summarizes the debate and explains the final consensus, and highlights areas of divergence or ambiguity. 

We test our platform on the Galileo dataset, choosing examples that represent high-stakes, easily disputed scenarios. And just like Galileo’s telescope in the 17th century, and NASA’s Galileo space mission in 1989, our system will revolutionize the search for truth and meaning in our universe.

What makes our system unique is that it goes deeper than just a black-and-white answer. We know that truth is a slippery thing. So our system identifies discrepancies, but by framing the response in terms of cybernetics and epistemology, it also recognizes how truth evolves and varies across different contexts.
